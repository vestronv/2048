Use 'a', 'w', 's', 'd' to control flow of numbers.
'a' -> left
'd' -> right
'w' -> up
's' -> down
Have fun.
NOTE : If you want to use on windows than comment line 198, 199, 200 and uncomment line 201. But after doing that you 
need to press enter after every direction key you press('a','s','d','w').
